# Making Embedded Systems Final Project

## Exercise 1

An embedded system ive dreamed about designing for a while, is an underwater light.
This light is water activated (using hardware, not software), and when it is submerged, the light is activated, it records pressure and temperature(at the minimum), has a rechargeable battery (with charging chip), and has some sort of light transceiver (ir/visible) that is used to communicate with the device and modify internal settings(light color and intensity) and communicate data (temperature and pressure data) via serial.  It stores information on a flash chip that it reads and writes data to.
